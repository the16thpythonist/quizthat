22.05.2022 - First steps
------------------------

So I just created this project. What are the first steps I should be doing?

- The sidebar navigation to be one "home" screen and one "open question" which opens an example question. In the home
screen I probably want to have at least a widget which allows me to add more players.
- After all of this is done I should try the whole process of shipping it as an android app and actually trying to
run it on my phone to see how that goes...
